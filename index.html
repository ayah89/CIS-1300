<p> Hey Jude, don’t make it bad,Take a sad song and make it better, Remember to let her into your heart. 
	Then you can start to make it better Hey Jude, don’t be afraid. You were made to go out and get her.
	The minute you let her under your skin.Then you begin to make it better
	</p>
 <p>
 	 Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date: Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimm’d;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimm’d; But thy eternal summer shall not fade
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;
Nor shall Death brag thou wander’st in his shade,
When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st; So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
